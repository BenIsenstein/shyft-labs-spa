# E-commerce demonstration site for Shyft Labs by Ben Isenstein

A react app using vite, tailwindCSS, and redux.

Features products from (Fake Store API)[https://fakestoreapi.com/], and the two required pages - Product listing and cart.

The app is responsive and was built with a mobile-first approach.

## How to run this app locally
